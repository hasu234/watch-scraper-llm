G-Shock GWG-2000-1A1DR Gray IP Black Analog-Digital Dial Black Resin Strap Men's Watch Mud Resistant Barometer Altimeter G1175,Casio,65995,GWG-2000-1A1DR,4.3,"[{'Review Rating': '5.0', 'Review Text': 'I am a watch collector, and I indulge in G-Shocks. Before you continuing reading, beware, you might be tempted into getting this premium G-Shock - you are warned.\n\nSince I also have the GWG-1000, I will tend to compare these watches. Don\'t worry if you are not interested in the GWG-1000, it will just let you know where this lineage of Mudmaster is headed in the future...\n\nImages: When there are two watches in the image, the left is GWG-1000, right is GWG-2000. Note: GWG-1000 in the images sports the Maharishi edition strap, standard is a green one.\n\n1) Sapphire crystals are a standard on this watch. Per se, sapphire crystals are not overly expensive, perhaps ₹ 500-1000, but somehow only premium watches sport these crystals. For those who are not aware of sapphire, these are very hard crystals and will __not__ scratch with coins, keys, knives and a lot of daily items. Regular (non-premium) G-Shocks sport the mineral crystal, but I rarely, if ever, manage to scratch them because they are usually a few mm below the bezel which protects them.\n\n2) All metal button construction. The pattern on the buttons is different between the watches, and I like the 1000 better. However, the shape of the buttons themselves are pretty unique in the 2000 and definitely look better. I thing I definitely do not like in the 2000 is the crevices and grooves where the buttons meet the body, it will be very difficult to clean.\n\n3) Carbon core body in the latest version vs resin body in the older one. I am not worried about durability of the resin body at all, I think it will last decades as will the new material, the one advantage the carbon core body brings is that it makes the watch lighter.\n\n4) Talking about weight, the size of 2000 is visibly smaller than the older one, diameter as well as thickness, which should reduce weight further. However, the 2000 now wears a steel bezel which negates some weight loss. However, GWG-2000 does feel lighter on the wrist.\n\n5) The strap is resin for both, no Carbon Fiber love yet. Strap retainer for the 1000 is steel, 2000 is resin. I have never experienced broken strap retainers with even my lowest end G-Shocks, so I am not worried.\n\n6) Module numbers for both are different (5463 for 1000, 5678 for 2000), and yet they have __exactly__ the same functions - Multiband 6 (of no use in India, of use only in China, Japan, Europe and North America), solar, Alti-Baro-Compass-Temp sensors, no GPS, no accelerometer, no SPO2 or Hearbeat, and the other pretty standard G-Shock features. There are no extraordinary features in this module that are unique or newly introduced - these sensors can be found on a number of Protrek and other sub-premium watches. It is surprising to see the module numbers are different even though they are exactly the same features, there could be a difference in module because of difference in LED used, 2000 has a much brighter LED.\n\n7) These watches sport negative LCD screens, and they are __not__ my favourite as they are very difficult to read. However, the 2000 has a better contrast slightly greenish LCD and is much more legible in various lighting conditions, though nothing beats a positive display. This is one place where Casio weighs form over function.\n\n8) The sub-hand is literally a Christmas tree in the 2000 version. The dial is more textured as well, and gives feeling of a circuit board when put at a certain angle.\n\n9) Don\'t be fooled by the dark hour-markets, they light up quite nicely when in dark. Overall I like the lume of 2000 better than 1000, it seems to ""capture"" more light quickly and shine brighter. However, don\'t expect either watches to hold the brightness late into the night, my guess is 1-2 hours would be maximum they will hold up illuminating after being exposed to reasonable light.\n\n10) Both are ""Assembled in Thailand"" as most Casio G-Shocks are, however the module are both Japanese.\n\n11) Both watches have 4 independent motors that drive the second, minute, hour and the mode hand. Which means that when the hands need to move out of the way, or change to world time, the transition is pretty fast.\n\n12) Hands moving out of the way is one more common feature in mid-high end watches - when you change the mode and there is something important to show on the digital screen, the hands will move out of the way and ""park"" themselves for a few seconds for you to see the LCD screen unhindered. Not a novelty anymore, but it is notable.\n\n13) This is a Master of G watch (premium G-Shocks), so one does not usually talk about ""value for money"", it is analogous to not asking fuel economy of a luxury car. The watch certainly commands very high premium, and well, it deserves most of it - the build quality, the premium-ness it oozes, the steely looks, the detailed work on the dial, bezel, caseback and strap...\n\nIts a great watch, and certainly one of the collectible ones - if you are into that. However, I agree with most reviews, if you have the GWG-1000, it is not a massive upgrade, and you will survive your days without having to think too much of the new version. If you don\'t own a GWG-1000, you may still not get the GWG-2000 and wait for, another 4 years before the GWG-3000 comes out (yes, there was a 5 year gap between 1000 and 2000).\n\nMy thoughts on what I expect from the next iteration, whenever that happens:\n1) Carbon fiber and fully user-changeable straps\n2) GPS - though this will necessitate a bigger digital screen, so very low chances\n3) Bluetooth for sure\n4) Stepcounter, its a small thing to add (I suppose)\n5) Mode customization to hide some modes (a feature some Timex digital watches have, and I love!)\n6) Multiple quick swappable time-zones (also much like Timex again)\n7) More alarms, 12 maybe (why not, one of their training stopwatches from years ago already provides this)\n8) Repeatable and multi timers (not new in Casio)\nI know it is asking a lot. But setting a high goal hopefully gets us somewhere near. :)\n\nFun Facts:\nThere are ₹ 600 watches which are copies of GWG-1000 (and perhaps now the newer iteration) - big, chunky and, well, handsome in a way. Someday I want to try them out. Someday...\n\nNote: I am not just in premium watches, I enjoy the F91W and CA53 with equal love (sometimes more).

I would say that they are three (3) attributes to look for when purchasing a watch.\n\nI initially purchased this watch when I was browsing for a digital watch that I could use for timing purposes when cooking in my kitchen. I came across this Casio and was immediately thrown back to ten (10) year old me. Granted, this is an updated model (early 1990's I believe?), but it looks exactly as I remember my 1984 model that was given to me as a birthday gift in either 1985 or 1986. That particular one was black and had a black resin strap as opposed to the stainless steel and silver plastic of this watch.\n\nI loved that watch when I was a kid. Oh sure, the light sucked the big one and could illuminate nothing more than the first digit in the dark; and it appears that nothing has changed. I still can't tell you what time it is without turning on the room light, except for maybe the hour, but I love it anyway.\n\nAnd yes, the quality of the materials is cheap. My original black resin eventually tore at the strap from repeated motion of putting it on and taking it off of my wrist. This version has a stainless steel band, but it's thin and not the highest quality of stainless. That doesn't matter though because I love it anyway.\n\nIt says that it is water resistant, but I'm not 100% sure of that. I don't think I would go swimming while wearing this watch, and I always take it off when I get a shower. However it's probably fine and I am not worried about getting it wet. My original took many a dunk in the water and kept on working, so I love it.\n\nThe face of the watch scratches easy, just like my original, so it's probably just glass or plastic. I'm not as rough as I was when I was a kid, so it isn't something that I am worried about. I paid $22.00 for this watch, so abuse is not something that needs to be a concern. There can be a small amount of glare depending upon the location of a light source, but no worries, I love it anyway.\n\nFor $22.00 what you get is an amazing watch that does everything it is supposed to and nothing more. at its price point I could purchase a half a dozen or more of these watches for the same cost as I watch (Invicta) I got for Christmas a few years ago, which was my former daily watch.\n\nI set the time using the website https://time.is and I'm impressed with the accuracy. After four (4) weeks its lost perhaps a few milli-seconds, I don't know. it definitely hasn't lost a full second of time yet, that much I do know.\n\nSure, it's a little small, but it fits comfortably on my arm, and the strap is easily adjustable for various sized wrists using no tools. The clasp can be moved up and down the strap for a tighter or looser fit.\n\nIf this watch is anything like my old black resin version it will also be quite reliable. That old watch was in the bottom of a junk drawer strapless and scratched up, but the battery kept it ticking away for years and years. I can't put a precise time on it, but if I were to make a guess I would say somewhere in the range of ten (10) years or more.\n\nEventually I grew up and moved away, but that old watch stayed at the bottom of the junk drawer inside my parent's house. It's gone now unfortunately. My mother told me that she cleaned out that drawer years and years ago, throwing away most of what was inside of it. It's probably accumulated another twenty years or more of junk since the last time it was cleaned out.\n\nNostalgia can be a powerful motivator, but this is an all around good watch regardless.

For someone who wants it I don’t demotivate you from buying it it’s worth its price — you should consider it, I’m a huge fan of its minimalistic appeal and the fact it doesn’t have any ribs to indicate hours like normal watches, I like the clean appeal, one more thing I noted was the strap quality , unlike the cheap straps found in most watches in this category this one doesn’t cause any irritation due my skin but one or two joints inside the strap have stiffened and that is not comfortable to use, but when you forcefully adjust it it works, for someone buying this I would recommend you change the strap from a nearby watch shop.

For its price, it provides quite accurate measurements of your BPM, stress, SPO2 etc. I have verified it\'s measurements with an actual oximeter and it proved to be accurate. However, the pedometer of the watch randomly adds around 100 steps. The pedometer is accurate otherwise.\n\nThe touch display of the 1.69"" watch impressed me. The watch has a sharp display, and smooth touch, which makes you feel like you are on a smartphone. The response time is quite well too. However, the animations lag which is not very eye pleasing, but workable.\n\nThe battery is great. The watch would be powered on for one whole night and would not lose a single percent of battery. Even while using, it loses a reasonable amount of power. For first time users, who just received their product: You might notice the battery is draining extremely quick. Do not panic. It is recommended to charge the battery for at least 2 hours before first use. It stabilizes the battery. The next time you use your watch, it would work as normal.\n\nThe built-in Alexa is perhaps my favorite feature of this watch. It\'s response time is around 5 seconds, and is quite fun to use a virtual assistant on the go. It can tell you facts, jokes, weather, calculations, translations and loads of other stuff, which might be useful for quickly looking up something. However, Alexa does not have a speaker. It gives a text output. The text output can sometimes end with ""..."" (ellipses) which mean the output is too long to print. It can also fail to provide relevant output at times.\nYou need to log in to Alexa with your Amazon account in the boAt Wave App.\n\nThere are 100+ watch faces in the wave app, which you can use to customize your watch with whatever that suits your personality. You can even use your own pictures. However, you cannot customize the time font if you choose to do that, which, in my opinion, is quite limiting.\n\nNotifications in the watch is pretty cool, and comes in handy when you do not wish to open your phone for it. Call alerts come, and you can reject them but not accept. Makes sense as the watch does not have a speaker. It vibrates.\n\nIt has a good build quality and is water-resistant.\n\nOther cool features are sleep tracking, breathing exercise, alarms, timers, flashlights etc.\n\nOverall, a pretty decent watch if you are looking for something in this range of price.', 'Reviewer Name': 'Placeholder', 'Review Date': 'Reviewed in India on 7 May 2022'}, {'Review Rating': '5.0', 'Review Text': 'Beautiful colour as shown in picture', 'Reviewer Name': 'Lizanne miranda', 'Review Date': 'Reviewed in India on 5 October 2024'}, {'Review Rating': '5.0', 'Review Text': '""I\'m absolutely thrilled with my new [Boat] watch!

Additionally, it has multiple sports modes, which are useful for tracking different types of exercises.\n\nOn the downside, the software could use some improvement. The interface sometimes lags, and I’ve experienced occasional syncing issues with the companion app. The notifications feature is basic and doesn’t always work as expected. Also, the accuracy of the fitness metrics isn’t always reliable, especially when comparing it with other fitness trackers.\n\nOverall, the Fire-Boltt Smartwatch is a decent option if you’re looking for a budget-friendly wearable with basic functionality.

The watch, priced at around 3,000 INR, combines style and functionality with a few noteworthy features.\n\nFirst and foremost, the automatic mechanical movement is impressive. If worn for 8 hours a day, the watch can go almost a week without needing to be wound, which is a fantastic convenience for daily wear. The intricate skeleton design adds a touch of elegance, making it a conversation starter.\n\nThe leather strap is of high quality and exudes a premium feel. Even after 4 months of daily wear, the leather remains comfortable on the wrist. However, there is a minor issue on the buckle side where I've noticed some damage but it is after 4 months of usage. This is likely due to the daily wear and tear, and it's a bit disappointing given the otherwise durable build of the watch.\n\nDespite the slight damage, the watch has held up well, and the skeletonized dial continues to function flawlessly. The timekeeping accuracy has been reliable, and I appreciate not having to worry about winding it constantly.\n\nI plan to provide an update on the watch's performance after a year of usage to give a more comprehensive review of its long-term durability. Despite the minor quirk, I still recommend the Benyar watch to those looking for a stylish and reliable automatic timepiece at an affordable price.\n\nEdit : It's a bit bulky and heavy for a watch"", 'Reviewer Name': 'Tushar', 'Review Date': 'Reviewed in India on 23 January 2024'}, {'Review Rating': '5.0', 'Review Text': ""Fully satisfied and happy with the quality of the watch.

Unlike many smartwatches that require daily charging, the OnePlus Smartwatch manages to last several days on a single charge, making it highly convenient for users with busy lifestyles.\n\nThe display is another highlight. It is both smooth and sharp, delivering vibrant colors and crisp details that make interacting with the watch a pleasure. Whether you’re checking notifications, tracking your fitness, or simply telling the time, the display quality enhances every interaction.\n\nPerformance-wise, the smartwatch is impressively quick. Navigating through menus, launching apps, and responding to notifications are all handled with remarkable speed and fluidity, ensuring a frustration-free experience.\n\nHowever, this level of quality and performance does come at a price. The OnePlus Smartwatch is a bit on the expensive side, which may be a consideration for budget-conscious buyers.

The tempered glass crystal has a blue tint that makes this watch visually striking. The band is a bit light and has a few tiny rough edges—not enough to be visible—but feels good on the wrist. The signed butterfly clasp is a nice touch. The band is held to the case with spring pins, so it’s easily removable if you wanted to replace it with something with a little more heft and better finishing.\n\nAs for the size, it has a 45 mm case, 53 mm lug-to-lug, so it fits very nicely on my medium-sized wrist. The band is 22 mm, tapering to 20 mm at the clasp.\n\nThe included Instruction Manual covers five different Nibosi styles, but not this chronograph, so my review of the chrono features is based on my personal observations rather than anything I could find out from Nibosi. Pressing the upper button, starts the chrono function; pressing it again pauses it. Pressing the lower button, resets the chrono *unless* one full minute has elapsed. That’s when things get weird.\n\nThe 12:00 subdial indicates 10ths of a second, measuring 2 seconds with each sweep, however, it stops moving after a full 60 seconds (30 sweeps) have elapsed. The rest of the subdials continue to mark time. Oddly, when you pause the chronograph, this hand jumps to a new location, possibly where it would have been if it had continued moving? When you press the button again, this hand jumps back to zero, and the other dials continue. Pressing again, makes all the subdials stop, except this one which again spins around to (possibly) where it would have been in real time.\n\nThe 6:00 subdial indicates seconds. When reset, it spins backwards for every minute that has elapsed. It doesn’t just jump back to zero, it literally unwinds itself to get back to zero. The 9:00 subdial indicates minutes and behaves the same, unwinding time to the pace of the 6:00 subdial, i.e., it ticks back one minute for each full backward spin of the 6:00 subdial. If you press the lower button before the chrono finishes resetting, it will stop in place without reaching zero.\n\nThis chrono’s behavior left me so confused that I tried it with my other chronos—no, they all just reset back to zero with a snap like a stopwatch would. I’m not going to reduce my rating over this—but I do find it very odd.\n\nOne last point—on the watch I received, the face is very slightly off-center in the clockwise direction. This means that all the hands are just slightly to the left of the indices. I can’t set the time to the marks; as soon as I push in the crown, the minute hand jumps to the where the movement thinks the marks should be. The second hand sweeps around the dial, clicking to a consistent position just left of the marks.\n\nAll-in-all, it’s a beautiful watch and I’ll probably wear it regardless of its odd flaws.', 'Reviewer Name': 'Gazrath', 'Review Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on 23 July 2023'}, {'Review Rating': '5.0', 'Review Text': 'This looks great and honestly fit my style, however it was a tad bit too big.

Looks great and has a nice weight to it... doesn't look or feel cheap at all. The stopwatch dials for seconds and minutes actually work and aren't there just for decoration like some cheaper watches. I was looking at other much more expensive name brand dress watches in the $150-$200 range but decided to save some $$$ and give this one a try. So far I'm very happy with the purchase. The pictures in the description made the band of the one I chose appear more of a gunmetal gray when in reality the band is black metal, but the face has a very nice dark blue hue to it. The gold time markers and hands make a nice, easy to read contrast. I have a small wrist so I had to use the pin removal tool that IS INCLUDED to take a couple of links out. Remember, if you have to use the tool, the pins only push out one way! HINT: look at the end of the pin on each side of the band and push from the side that looks slightly recessed vs the side the pin looks flat and even with the band. When replacing the pin, push the narrow end in first vs the slightly bowed end. A pair of needle-nose pliers make for an easy final set of the pin, getting it all the way in to the link. Like I said, I'm very happy with my decision to purchase this watch, and I saved a lot of money over the ones I was originally considering.

It's also worth noting how easy it is to detach and reattach the straps, a feature I really appreciate as I wash the strap at least once a week; something I couldn’t do with my previous Watch 5 Pro.\n\nBattery: With well over 2 and half days of battery life with heartrate monitoring every 10 minutes, this is finally the Wear OS Watch I have always wanted. That said, the watch still takes about 2 hours to fully charge. The charging pad also needs to be carried around since the Watch no longer supports reverse charging via your phone.\n\nTracking: I work out almost daily, and the watch has never failed to accurately track my activities. The heart rate monitor, ECG, and AGEs also seem to work well. I couldn’t test the BP sensor, as it requires calibration before use. It’s a minor inconvenience, but it would have been nice if it came precalibrated.\n\nSaying I’m happy with this product would be an understatement; it has exceeded all my expectations.

With how well apple OS is integrated, It is possible to bring the the most out of you apple watch as compared to any other smartwatch (when used with an iPhone)\n2. The display is brilliant. Very high resolution. Animations are crisp and well thought. The limitless watch faces will leave you confused (in a good way) and you’d want to try new watch faces almost everyday.\n3. The way so many apps have gotten synced with the watch is mesmerising. Apps like MyGate, Prime Music, metronome beats, google keep, google maps etc., have gotten synced seamlessly.\n4. The watch is very comfortable to put on. The silicon strap is of very high quality. You can keep the watch on for the whole day as well as night and it’d not bother you. Even when it is hot outside, it wont bother you much.\n5. build quality is above average. Fit & finish is very satisfying. I mean what else can you expect from a watch that costs 25K+?\n\nCons:\n1. Like almost every other apple products, Apple watch SE is also an expensive proposition.\n2. The biggest con is that apple ecosystem is monopolistic and any other smartwatch or a fitness tracker won’t ever work seamlessly with an iPhone\n3. Apple watch does not synchronise with the iPad which was surprising. Only health data gets synced. I’d love to see some more integration with the watch and iPads.\n4. Misses blood oxygen sensor. I mean it is absolutely bonkers to realise that even watches costing below 3K come with blood oxygen sensors and this one doesn’t. Absolutely enraging and even though its not a must have feature, I have paid a handsome amount so I’d like to have it. The one star I have given less is for this reason!\n\nOverall, yes this is a true smartwatch and suffices your daily requirements! But apple has left a huge scope of improvements and I’d like them pushed as Os updates in the watch!

Ich benutze die Uhr seit ca. vier Wochen. Als Apple Fan wollte ich eigentlich die Ultra 2 Watch kaufen, aber der Preis schreckte mich dann doch ab. Nach langem suchen und Berichte lesen, Videos auf YouTube studiert, bin ich dann bei der Amazfit Falcon gelandet.\n\nIch möchte gleich mit zwei Kritikpunkten aufräumen die ich vor meinem Kauf auf YouTube und in den Bewertungen hier gelesen habe. Bei dieser Uhr sind natürlich diverse Zifferblätter für umsonst dabei. Aber die richtig schönen (Geschmacksache) sind käuflich zwischen 0,90 Cent - 2,99 Euro. zu erwerben. Wieso man sich deswegen gegen diese schöne Uhr entscheiden kann, das erschließt sich mir nicht! Auch bekomme ich keine nervige Werbung auf die App oder auf die Uhr geschickt, weil das im Zusammenhang mit den Zifferblättern in den Raum gestellt wurde!\n\nZweiter Punkt Ungenauigkeit der GPS Daten. und Darstellung auf der Karte der Uhr, falls diese zuvor entsprechend nach Anleitung über die App auf die Uhr übertragen wurde. Das wurde letztes Jahr in einem Video dargestellt und bemängelt. Die aufgezeichnete Wegstrecke ging dann schon mal auf der Karte sichtbar mitten durch ein Wohngebäude anstatt drumherum. 😉 Ich habe einige Aufzeichnungen unterwegs aufgenommen, und kann sagen das dieses Problem bei mir nicht aufgetreten war, weil es nicht an der Uhr selbst lag, sondern an der Software. Update und Fehler behoben.\n\nAlles in allem ist es ein tolle Uhr mit interessanten Funktionen, die optisch wirklich ins Auge sticht. Sie lässt sich bequem tragen, man könnte bei Bedarf sogar das Armband tauschen, da es abnehmbar ist, ich bin aber mit dem aus der Lieferung sehr zufrieden. Was mir jetzt nicht so gut gefallen hat, das nicht alle Messungen mit der Uhr selbst durchgeführt werden können, es bedarf hier und da überteuertes Zubehör wie diese legendäre Ring am Finger, der dann diverse Daten aus dem Finger saugt und an die Uhr übermittelt, weil diese das nicht mit ihren eigenen Sensoren kann. \U0001fae3\n\nTrotzdem kann ich diese Uhr für den Alltagsgebrauch mit tollen und interessanten Funktionen wirklich empfehlen. Für Extremsportler und Nutzer die Ultra genaue Messungen wie EKG usw. über die Uhr abrufen möchten, empfehle ich dann in dem Fall auch lieber die Ultra von Apple.

But if you're going for a nice statement watch, look no further! at 12mm thick, it doesn't fit nicely under a shirt cuff, but that lends it to making it always stick out and be admired! The metal finishing on the case could be done better however, as it feels a bit rough around the edges, but nothing cheap feeling, something you would only notice upon inspecting higher-end watches.\n\nThe leather strap feels of quality and is very comfortable to wear. it is 22mm wide and does not taper. My only issue with it is that it was a bit tricky to put it on and off initially, but after wearing it for a few days, it has finally broken in. It does show scratch marks and general use marks, even water stains are slightly visible in the underside of the strap, which may be an issue for some, but I personally find it look better with age. Fossil generally makes amazing leather products, and this strap is no exception.\n\nThe dial is easy to read despite having a large portion of it cut-out to reveal the automatic movement inside. This is due to the thickness of the hands, and their illumination in the dark. The hour markers do not illuminate. Having the ability to see the movement both through the back and front of the case really lets you appreciate what's happening inside this automatic watch.\n\nThe power reserve is rated at 40 hours, and have not found it running out of power with regular daily use. I did notice however that in the first few hours of wearing the watch (from my initial winding), the watch was running a bit faster, at a rate of around +20 seconds in 8 hours. After a few days, It came back to normal accuracy levels and stayed there, of around +- 8 seconds a day or so. Perhaps there is some break-in period when the mechanism first starts. (If yours is inaccurate initially, give it some time, maybe a week or so to see if it is running. If it's running consistently fast, it may be magnetized or worse, the lubrication needs to be regulated)\n\nThe crystal is the only downer I can think of in this watch, as it's only a hardened mineral crystal and not sapphire. But for the price, I wouldn't believe it if it said sapphire! It has a domed design which some may or may not like.\n\nThe Fossil branding is visible on the dial face, on the case-back, on the underside of the strap, on the steel buckle, and on the winding weight, which states it has 21 jewels.\n\nOverall I love the open design to see the automatic movement, and is a good entry point for people looking to get into the world of automatic/mechanical watches. Although it does have its flaws and is not the perfect watch, it's still a beautiful and reliable timepiece nonetheless. This watch comes in different types of configurations as well, from black dials, to metal bracelets, etc. Pick and choose whichever suits your style!\n\nHighly Recommended!"", 'Reviewer Name': 'AmazonCustomer', 'Review Date': 'Reviewed in Canada on 24 October 2017'}]",997,In stock,"{'item_weight': '76 g', 'case_material': 'Stainless Steel', 'crystal_material': 'Glass', 'band_material': 'Leather', 'water_resistant_depth': '50 Meters'}",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Z5n0DTigL._SX679_.jpg

The smooth plan, AMOLED show, and financial plan agreeable sticker price were all staggeringly enticing. In any case, following half a month of purpose, my lunar landing transformed into an accident arrival, leaving me feeling disheartened and baffled. Here\'s the reason:\n\nBroken Dreams: A Glass Face That Can\'t Face Reality\n\nThe Lunar Circle brags a ""exceptional"" 2.5D bended glass show. Tragically, ""premium"" appears to mean ""handily damaged and inclined to breaking."" A minor knock against a door jamb came about in a spiderweb of breaks, forever defacing the watch\'s style and raising worries about its strength. This is unsatisfactory for a watch intended for ordinary wear.\n\nBattery Duration: More Like a Lunar Obscuration, Than a Full Moon\n\nThe promoted battery duration of 7 days was another significant selling point. As a general rule, it\'s more like a lunar overshadowing - vanishing a lot quicker than anticipated. With even moderate use, including warnings and incidental wellness following, the battery scarcely endures 2 days. This steady need to re-energize is a significant burden and nullifies the point of a smartwatch that ought to have the option to stay aware of your dynamic way of life.\n\nSleepwalking with the Watch: A Wakeup Signal That is More Similar to a State of extreme lethargy\n\nThe Lunar Circle\'s wake-up signal should be natural, essentially raise your wrist and presto! Be that as it may, actually more much the same as attempting to wake a sleepwalker. The signal frequently neglects to enlist, leaving you bungling with the screen or fasten to enact it. This turns out to be unbelievably disappointing, particularly while attempting to rapidly take a look at the time or warnings.\n\nPast the Moon, However Not Past Dissatisfaction\n\nWhile the Lunar Circle makes them recover characteristics, similar to the fair AMOLED show and reasonable value, the negatives far offset the up-sides. The unfortunate glass quality, disheartening battery duration, and inconsistent wake-up motion make this watch even more a disappointment as opposed to an elegant frill. On the off chance that you\'re searching for a dependable and strong smartwatch, look past the moon and skirt this dull contribution from boAt.\n\nAll in all, the boAt Lunar Circle is a watch that offers too much however conveys a cratered experience. Except if you\'re searching for a delicate, fleeting style proclamation, I\'d suggest avoiding this lunar disillusionment.', 'Reviewer Name': 'manish bej', 'Review Date': 'Reviewed in India on 7 February 2024'}, {'Review Rating': '3.0', 'Review Text': 'Sensor not working after 2 weeks', 'Reviewer Name': 'Customer', 'Review Date': 'Reviewed in India on 13 October 2024'}, {'Review Rating': '5.0', 'Review Text': 'Best quality and value for money and nice producet 👌👌', 'Reviewer Name': 'Rahul Meena', 'Review Date': 'Reviewed in India on 2 October 2024'}, {'Review Rating': '4.0', 'Review Text': 'Overall qualities good', 'Reviewer Name': 'Best quality', 'Review Date': 'Reviewed in India on 8 October 2024'}, {'Review Rating': '5.0', 'Review Text': 'The boAt Lunar Orb smartwatch is an affordable, feature-packed device that offers excellent value for its price of around ₹1,399.\nIt features a 1.45-inch AMOLED display with an Always-On mode, providing vibrant visuals and a sleek design.

Ich benutze die Uhr seit ca. vier Wochen. Als Apple Fan wollte ich eigentlich die Ultra 2 Watch kaufen, aber der Preis schreckte mich dann doch ab. Nach langem suchen und Berichte lesen, Videos auf YouTube studiert, bin ich dann bei der Amazfit Falcon gelandet.\n\nIch möchte gleich mit zwei Kritikpunkten aufräumen die ich vor meinem Kauf auf YouTube und in den Bewertungen hier gelesen habe. Bei dieser Uhr sind natürlich diverse Zifferblätter für umsonst dabei. Aber die richtig schönen (Geschmacksache) sind käuflich zwischen 0,90 Cent - 2,99 Euro. zu erwerben. Wieso man sich deswegen gegen diese schöne Uhr entscheiden kann, das erschließt sich mir nicht! Auch bekomme ich keine nervige Werbung auf die App oder auf die Uhr geschickt, weil das im Zusammenhang mit den Zifferblättern in den Raum gestellt wurde!\n\nZweiter Punkt Ungenauigkeit der GPS Daten. und Darstellung auf der Karte der Uhr, falls diese zuvor entsprechend nach Anleitung über die App auf die Uhr übertragen wurde. Das wurde letztes Jahr in einem Video dargestellt und bemängelt. Die aufgezeichnete Wegstrecke ging dann schon mal auf der Karte sichtbar mitten durch ein Wohngebäude anstatt drumherum. 😉 Ich habe einige Aufzeichnungen unterwegs aufgenommen, und kann sagen das dieses Problem bei mir nicht aufgetreten war, weil es nicht an der Uhr selbst lag, sondern an der Software. Update und Fehler behoben.\n\nAlles in allem ist es ein tolle Uhr mit interessanten Funktionen, die optisch wirklich ins Auge sticht. Sie lässt sich bequem tragen, man könnte bei Bedarf sogar das Armband tauschen, da es abnehmbar ist, ich bin aber mit dem aus der Lieferung sehr zufrieden. Was mir jetzt nicht so gut gefallen hat, das nicht alle Messungen mit der Uhr selbst durchgeführt werden können, es bedarf hier und da überteuertes Zubehör wie diese legendäre Ring am Finger, der dann diverse Daten aus dem Finger saugt und an die Uhr übermittelt, weil diese das nicht mit ihren eigenen Sensoren kann. \U0001fae3\n\nTrotzdem kann ich diese Uhr für den Alltagsgebrauch mit tollen und interessanten Funktionen wirklich empfehlen. Für Extremsportler und Nutzer die Ultra genaue Messungen wie EKG usw. über die Uhr abrufen möchten, empfehle ich dann in dem Fall auch lieber die Ultra von Apple. PS: das neue aktuelle Model von Apple ist kein Upgrade auf die Ultra2 Watch. diese ist nach wie vor das Flaggschiff von Apple.

But if you're going for a nice statement watch, look no further! at 12mm thick, it doesn't fit nicely under a shirt cuff, but that lends it to making it always stick out and be admired! The metal finishing on the case could be done better however, as it feels a bit rough around the edges, but nothing cheap feeling, something you would only notice upon inspecting higher-end watches.\n\nThe leather strap feels of quality and is very comfortable to wear. it is 22mm wide and does not taper. My only issue with it is that it was a bit tricky to put it on and off initially, but after wearing it for a few days, it has finally broken in. It does show scratch marks and general use marks, even water stains are slightly visible in the underside of the strap, which may be an issue for some, but I personally find it look better with age. Fossil generally makes amazing leather products, and this strap is no exception.\n\nThe dial is easy to read despite having a large portion of it cut-out to reveal the automatic movement inside. This is due to the thickness of the hands, and their illumination in the dark. The hour markers do not illuminate. Having the ability to see the movement both through the back and front of the case really lets you appreciate what's happening inside this automatic watch.\n\nThe power reserve is rated at 40 hours, and have not found it running out of power with regular daily use. I did notice however that in the first few hours of wearing the watch (from my initial winding), the watch was running a bit faster, at a rate of around +20 seconds in 8 hours. After a few days, It came back to normal accuracy levels and stayed there, of around +- 8 seconds a day or so. Perhaps there is some break-in period when the mechanism first starts. (If yours is inaccurate initially, give it some time, maybe a week or so to see if it is running. If it's running consistently fast, it may be magnetized or worse, the lubrication needs to be regulated)\n\nThe crystal is the only downer I can think of in this watch, as it's only a hardened mineral crystal and not sapphire. But for the price, I wouldn't believe it if it said sapphire! It has a domed design which some may or may not like.\n\nThe Fossil branding is visible on the dial face, on the case-back, on the underside of the strap, on the steel buckle, and on the winding weight, which states it has 21 jewels.\n\nOverall I love the open design to see the automatic movement, and is a good entry point for people looking to get into the world of automatic/mechanical watches. Although it does have its flaws and is not the perfect watch, it's still a beautiful and reliable timepiece nonetheless. This watch comes in different types of configurations as well, from black dials, to metal bracelets, etc. Pick and choose whichever suits your style!\n\nHighly Recommended!"", 'Reviewer Name': 'AmazonCustomer', 'Review Date': 'Reviewed in Canada on 24 October 2017'}]",997,In stock,"{'item_weight': '76 g', 'case_material': 'Stainless Steel', 'crystal_material': 'Glass', 'band_material': 'Leather', 'water_resistant_depth': '50 Meters'}",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Z5n0DTigL._SX679_.jpg

It\'s a great addition that makes the Fastrack New Limitless FS1 Smart Watch even more useful.\n\nAnd let\'s not forget about the battery life. With a mega 7-day battery, you won\'t have to worry about constantly charging your watch. This is especially important if you\'re someone who\'s always on the go and doesn\'t have time to charge their devices constantly.\n\nThe ATS Chipset with Zero Lag is also a standout feature.

The black dial is stepped and the Roman numeral hour markers are applied. The day/date window is framed, and the Dauphine hour and minute hands have lume applied. There are also round hour indices on the chapter ring that have applied lume as well, although it doesn\'t last long.\n\nThe case is metal and has the polished appearance of stainless steel, although I have not tested the scratch resistance to see if the case is actually stainless or if only the caseback is stainless. They claim the case is stainless and I have no reason to doubt that other than the low price, and if that is true this will be a good durable watch. The crystal is mineral glass, not acrylic, so it is more resistant to scratching than most watches in this price range. It has a snap-on caseback and a non-screw down crown, so water-resistance is minimal. Avoid getting it wet.\n\nThe 9-link bracelet has a butterfly clasp with no micro-adjustment, but links can be removed to fit the bracelet. There are no half-links, so fit will be close but perhaps not precise. It came oversized for my 7.75"" wrist, and I removed two links to get the best fit for me. The bracelet is a bit jangly since clearances are loose, but this is not uncommon in a watch at this price range.\n\nThe case measures 42 mm in diameter, so it is a medium-sized watch, but it doesn\'t look or wear big. Lug tip to lug tip is 47 mm, but the lugs angle down quite a bit so it conforms to the wrist rather than sitting on top of it. The case is only 9.5mm thick, which on its own is quite slender, but the way the case is tapered from top to bottom it gives a smaller and even more slender appearance which is comfortable to wear and attractive. There is no anti-reflective coating, so in bright light you can get a glare, but this is very common at this price point. Legibility of the sliver hands on the black dial is excellent.\n\nOverall, this is a lot of watch for the money, and it looks very nice, crossing the lines between business and dress watch.', 'Reviewer Name': 'Dan', 'Review Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on 24 March 2024'}, {'Review Rating': '5.0', 'Review Text': ""I wear a wrist watch every day. I have a collection. I had never heard of Nibosi before getting this watch. It is one of the cheapest watches I have. It looks much more expensive than it is. Aside from that, I know that a standard quartz movement can be more accurate and durable at a fraction of the price of any mechanical movement. I assume that this watch company, like many others, buys the movement from a different manufacturer that specializes in quartz movements. Still, it must be difficult to get a watch to look good for such a low price as this one ($20). My 5 stars only reflects this fact - that for a very low price, you get a decent looking watch, with day and date, that will serve your every day needs. If you want to rate it on a more absolute scale, of great brand-name watches, then I am afraid it will rank low - maybe 1-2 stars (I can cite many reasons).\n\nIt took me quite a while to get the band fitted correctly. The watch came with a pin awl that is used to push out the pins holding the links. But this turned out to be impossible. I have a watchmaker's tool kit, which has a small hammer and a tool to set the chain into so the links can be gently tapped out. Anyway, after several trials I was able to get the right number of links; the result is adequate but not great. The fit is a little tight. If I add a link it is too loose. Another aspect is that this watch is on the big side at 40mm diameter. The watches I normally wear are 30-35mm. If your wrist is small, as mine is, this can look too big.\n\nI don't know the durability.

I always had Titan in the back of my mind as i had used it during my college days. Then on December 8th I found this watch in the Deal of the day on Amazon. Its MRP is Rs 2795 but it was on offer for just one day for Rs 1635 on purchase with ICICI credit card, which was a straight 50% discount. I grabbed this offer and i dont regret it. It was being sold by Cloudtel on Amazon. The finish quality is excellent and the product looks premium. The leather strap is genuine leather and feels really comfortable. The day and date functions efficiently. The dial has 12 and 24 hour time printed on it.

The material is lightweight and breathable, which is a huge plus, especially during workouts or hot weather. The adjustable nature ensures a perfect fit for any wrist size, from small to large.\n\n### Design and Style\nThe black and blue color combination adds a sporty and stylish touch to your Mi Band, making it look more like a fashion accessory rather than just a fitness tracker.

The precise cutouts and secure clasp design provide added peace of mind.\n\n### Value for Money\nGiven its high-quality construction, stylish design, and excellent comfort, the Sounce Premium Silicone Adjustable Watch Band is reasonably priced. It offers great value for money, especially considering its durability and versatility.\n\n### Compatibility\nA quick note for potential buyers: this strap is specifically designed for Xiaomi Mi Band 5 and Mi Band 6.

While this watch is relatively new in the market, the first positive point for me was the fact that it's branded, which reduces the likelihood of being landed with a non-functional piece. I've used Boat products earlier, and have been pretty happy with my purchases thus far. The price too seemed reasonable for the features listed.\n\nComing to the watch itself, it came packaged well and was in a sealed, original box. It was fully charged, so I could get started with it immediately. It came with a user manual, charging cable, SIM slot opener and a bunch of stickers for kids. It connected to WiFi instantly and I was able to bind it to the app on my phone without any trouble. The mobile app itself is crisp, easy to understand and syncs changes with the watch in seconds.\n\nPros:\n1. Lightweight\n2. Decent size watch face\n3. Smooth touchscreen\n4. Easy flip navigation\n5. Soft buttons\n6. Really clear front-facing camera\n7. Decent GPS (there are times when it doesn't show the exact location and is about 100 meters away. That's fine by me because it still gets me an approximate location).\n8. Very good sound\n9. Good parental controls via the app\n10. Decent battery life even after taking it off power saving mode\n11. Includes a pedometer that tracks activity. Great to make sure that a kid (or in my case a senior) stays active.\n12. Changeable watch faces makes this watch interesting.\n\nCons:\n1. The chat application on the watch allows only emojis and voice messages. There is no keyboard to type a text message although the app on the phone has this option. There might be situations where a kid may not be able to send a voice message. Including a keyboard is definitely doable because they do have one to enter the WiFi password.\n\nNice to have:\n1. It would have been great to allow calls via WiFi. The watch right now allows SOS calls or voice calls only when a SIM is installed. Of course this is functionality has been created under the valid assumption that a child would be outdoors and require assistance, during which time a SIM would be the most ideal connectivity point. But in a scenario where mobile network is unavailable but WiFi is, it would have been great to have at least the SOS calls directly via WiFi as well.\n2. It would have been awesome to have an SpO2 and heart rate monitor inbuilt, just like there is a pedometer right now.\n3. A few more apps would have been nice. Calculator, calendar, compass and anything else really basic to extend this watch's functionality."", 'Reviewer Name': 'Roma', 'Review Date': 'Reviewed in India on 22 September 2024'}, {'Review Rating': '1.0', 'Review Text': 'I bought just 1 first thinking I’ll see how it works and then order another for my second child… but it’s very bad quality.. and only on the second days after charging 100% in the night, my child wore it to school and by 12 noon the battery was already on red, and this non of the features work until u charge it.. not even calls, what’s the point of having a watch with just 5hrs of battery..

It feels quite heavy and large on my small wrist which is about 55mm across the wrist and 15cm circumference (female). The weight may be reduced by removing some links.\n\nColour:\nVery nice rose-gold, like pale 'salmon'. I was unable to match the true colour on the photo. Overall, the colour is pleasing.\n\nMy verdict:\nI was tempted to return the watch because it felt too large and bulky on my small wrist. Yet, after having worn it for a few hours during work, I decided to keep it and I am starting to like the look of the large watch. I also like that the face can be illuminated. For a more elegant look, for ladies with small wrists, I may recommend a smaller watch. I am quite tempted to purchase a smaller, stainless steel, ladies' watch for a more casual look. I have to say, my CASIO watches have never failed me.\n\nDimensions, which I may have measured differently to the manufacturer’s:\n\nStainless watch overall, across wrist, incl. extension for wristband attachments: 40mm\nWidth along length of wrist: 37mm\nDisplay face: 20mm x 13mm\nSize of hour figures: 7mm\nMinute figures: 5mm\nDate figures: 3mm\nBand length with fixed catch: 70mm\nBand length with movable catch: 105mm\nBand width: 17mm\nLinks: 6mm\nWeight with all band links: about 65g\n\n65g does not appear ‘heavy’, but if one is not used to wearing a stainless-steel watch it ‘feels’ heavy and bulky to start with. The length of the links is ample for a larger wrist.

One plus was an obvious choice as I already have one plus mobile and I found one plus watch has very good and fitness features and overall watch experience. Here is what I experienced..\n\nLook and build:\n* Excellent design and looks. Many watch faces to chose from.\n* Sturdy and durable build quality\n* Feels super premium\n\nUser experience:\n* Excellent Google Wear OS experience\n* Smooth and responsive UI, no lag at all\n* Very convenient to see all notification on the wrist, which can be controlled of course to avoid distraction\n* We can reply to WhatsApp chat or other apps through watch if needed. Excellent watch keyboard for quick reply.\n* Calling on watch is excellent\n* Very convenient to change music track while doing workout as I put mobile aside during workouts.\n* Various workout and fitness stats are also available in watch\n* OHealth app is good and easy to use\n\nWorkout and fitness:\n* Excellent workout stats and analysis\n* Great Sleep analysis\n* Sensors are very accurate. Heartrate, SPO2, Sleep detection, balance everything is accurate. GPS is also accurate while we do outdoor workout like running/walking etc.\n* Note that heartrate sensors are continuously measuring during workout only. Without workout it measures periodically (may be once in a minute or so).\nFew activities have in depth statistics for example running, tennis, badminton. There could be more but I could test these only so far. Check attached screenshots to see the stats.\n\nRunning:\nVery accurate running stats. Sensors are able to measure all readings and shows in depth statistics. It also shows cardiovascular stats. GPS is also very accurate and able to track the route while I was running in a street having 16 story apartments on both the sides.\n\nPickleball:\n* I used tennis workout to track pickleball and it was able to capture stats like number of forehead, backend shots, max swing speed accurately. See the attached image.\n\nWeights and strength training:\n* There is strength training workout option. There is also upper limb, lower limb, back, chest and different workouts, they all essentially measures heart rate continuously. Not much in depth analysis but it captures in which zone you did these workout.\n\nCharging:\n* With breathing analysis on which is battery intensive, I get 2.5 to 3 days battery, provided that I do 1 to 1.5 hours daily workout, which also uses battery as sensors are continuously on during workout. It's not a problem for me as there is quick charting. If I turn of breathing analysis then battery might get extended by 1 to 1.5 days.\n\nPros:\n* Excellent premium look with great build quality\n* Price - Excellent wear os watch, with this quality and features at this price\n* Great workouts and statistics\n* Very good calling experience\n* Excellent sleep analysis\n\nCons:\n* A bit heavier and bulky if you are moving from some light weight tracker. If someone is already using other watch and buying this then won't observe this as an issue. Infect they might find this a bit lighter.\n\nGood to have:\n* Continuous heart rate monitoring - it measures heart rate continuously during activity and sleep (when advanced breathing assessment is on), but not otherwise\n* Readiness score - Score which tells how much workout you can do today, based on how your body and heart responded to yesterday's workout Probably somewhat covered under recovery stats"", 'Reviewer Name': 'Keyur Chauhan', 'Review Date': 'Reviewed in India on 20 August 2024'}, {'Review Rating': '4.0', 'Review Text': ""Great experience using the watch for nearly a month now.

The tempered glass crystal has a blue tint that makes this watch visually striking. The band is a bit light and has a few tiny rough edges—not enough to be visible—but feels good on the wrist. The signed butterfly clasp is a nice touch. The band is held to the case with spring pins, so it’s easily removable if you wanted to replace it with something with a little more heft and better finishing.\n\nAs for the size, it has a 45 mm case, 53 mm lug-to-lug, so it fits very nicely on my medium-sized wrist. The band is 22 mm, tapering to 20 mm at the clasp.\n\nThe included Instruction Manual covers five different Nibosi styles, but not this chronograph, so my review of the chrono features is based on my personal observations rather than anything I could find out from Nibosi. Pressing the upper button, starts the chrono function; pressing it again pauses it. Pressing the lower button, resets the chrono *unless* one full minute has elapsed. That’s when things get weird.\n\nThe 12:00 subdial indicates 10ths of a second, measuring 2 seconds with each sweep, however, it stops moving after a full 60 seconds (30 sweeps) have elapsed. The rest of the subdials continue to mark time. Oddly, when you pause the chronograph, this hand jumps to a new location, possibly where it would have been if it had continued moving? When you press the button again, this hand jumps back to zero, and the other dials continue. Pressing again, makes all the subdials stop, except this one which again spins around to (possibly) where it would have been in real time.\n\nThe 6:00 subdial indicates seconds. When reset, it spins backwards for every minute that has elapsed. It doesn’t just jump back to zero, it literally unwinds itself to get back to zero. The 9:00 subdial indicates minutes and behaves the same, unwinding time to the pace of the 6:00 subdial, i.e., it ticks back one minute for each full backward spin of the 6:00 subdial. If you press the lower button before the chrono finishes resetting, it will stop in place without reaching zero.\n\nThis chrono’s behavior left me so confused that I tried it with my other chronos—no, they all just reset back to zero with a snap like a stopwatch would. I’m not going to reduce my rating over this—but I do find it very odd.\n\nOne last point—on the watch I received, the face is very slightly off-center in the clockwise direction. This means that all the hands are just slightly to the left of the indices. I can’t set the time to the marks; as soon as I push in the crown, the minute hand jumps to the where the movement thinks the marks should be. The second hand sweeps around the dial, clicking to a consistent position just left of the marks.\n\nAll-in-all, it’s a beautiful watch and I’ll probably wear it regardless of its odd flaws.', 'Reviewer Name': 'Gazrath', 'Review Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on 23 July 2023'}, {'Review Rating': '5.0', 'Review Text': 'This looks great and honestly fit my style, however it was a tad bit too big.

Despite my small wrists, the watch fits perfectly, thanks to the ingenious strap design that accommodates Small, Medium, and Large wrists. It's also worth noting how easy it is to detach and reattach the straps, a feature I really appreciate as I wash the strap at least once a week; something I couldn’t do with my previous Watch 5 Pro.\n\nBattery: With well over 2 and half days of battery life with heartrate monitoring every 10 minutes, this is finally the Wear OS Watch I have always wanted. That said, the watch still takes about 2 hours to fully charge. The charging pad also needs to be carried around since the Watch no longer supports reverse charging via your phone.\n\nTracking: I work out almost daily, and the watch has never failed to accurately track my activities. The heart rate monitor, ECG, and AGEs also seem to work well. I couldn’t test the BP sensor, as it requires calibration before use. It’s a minor inconvenience, but it would have been nice if it came precalibrated.\n\nSaying I’m happy with this product would be an understatement; it has exceeded all my expectations.

I have a few different watches and this one is my new favourite. Of couse, like most watches, this one needed slight adjustment out of the box. I just removed one link and it fit perfectly. The only thing regarding the fit I can see being a problem for some is that there are no spring bars on the clasp for fine adjustment. For some, you may have trouble finding the perfect fit because each link is approx. 1cm long. This means if you need to reduce the size by 5mm, you are out of luck. I was surprised when I opened the watch because I wasn't expecting the blue part of the links to be silicone. I honestly think it is a good thing because it makes the watch very comfortable to wear. It is also a much darker (also more subtle) blue than in the pictures. The gold accents have a slight copper tint to them. Of course, being a quartz movement, you don't have to worry about the time being off. It might gain/lose 10 seconds per month, but that is very normal. The second hand seems to line up with the second marks most of the time. The watch band is extremely easy to remove. You don't even need a spring bar tool to remove it. There is a small piece you slide and it releases the spring bar, allowing for the watch band to be removed. I am not sure if that is common to Fossil watches, but I thought that was neat!

Having used smartwatches since 2021 and smart bands since 2016, I can confidently say that nothing has felt as good on my wrist; it's incredibly comfortable to wear. Despite my small wrists, the watch fits perfectly, thanks to the ingenious strap design that accommodates Small, Medium, and Large wrists. It's also worth noting how easy it is to detach and reattach the straps, a feature I really appreciate as I wash the strap at least once a week; something I couldn’t do with my previous Watch 5 Pro.\n\nBattery: With well over 2 and half days of battery life with heartrate monitoring every 10 minutes, this is finally the Wear OS Watch I have always wanted. That said, the watch still takes about 2 hours to fully charge. The charging pad also needs to be carried around since the Watch no longer supports reverse charging via your phone.\n\nTracking: I work out almost daily, and the watch has never failed to accurately track my activities. The heart rate monitor, ECG, and AGEs also seem to work well. I couldn’t test the BP sensor, as it requires calibration before use. It’s a minor inconvenience, but it would have been nice if it came precalibrated.\n\nSaying I’m happy with this product would be an understatement; it has exceeded all my expectations.

Sunrise sunset app along with detailed weather for travellers. So I could go on and on.\nAh yes, you can store music. Plenty of storage for music, apps and watch faces.

Invicta Pro-Diver Analog Black Dial Men's Watch-8926OB,Invicta,14999,,4.5,"[{'Review Rating': '5.0', 'Review Text': 'For people who don’t have time to read my complete review, here’s a brief review.\n\nBought for: ₹5808\nPros:\n1. Automatic Japanese Seiko movement\n2. Amazing build quality\n3. 200m water resistant\n4. Display back\n5. Screw down crown\n6. Rotating outer diver bezel\n7. Manual wind and hacking functions\n8. Looks like a Rolex Submariner\n\nCons:\n1. Looks a lot like a Rolex Submariner\n2. A bit tall on the wrist\n3. Servicing is tough in India for Invicta watches if something goes wrong\n4. A Little heavy on the bracelet\n5. Loom is very weak on the markers.\n\nSome people have complain about quality issues like misaligned markers or bezel, hands fell off etc. At the time of posting this review it’s been almost a month of daily use and I’m lucky to not have any issues in my piece.\n\nVerdict: It’s an absolute value for money (at least for what I’ve paid) and you can definitely go for it if you like the design.\n\nLoooong Review:\nTo be honest I’m a huge horological nerd and I absolutely love watches. I follow almost all watch communities on the internet and I have quite a decent collection of watches myself including Gshock, Seiko, Timex, automatic, manual wind and quartz movements etc. I always wanted to have an automatic diver in my collection and my first choice was a Seiko SKX which is a legendary diver watch. But when I searched I couldn’t find SKX on any website or retail stores in India. (Though later I found that Amazon is selling it in India but for an absurd price of more than 30k where as you could buy it in US for somewhere around 200 dollars) So I had no choice but to find an alternative and I came across Orient Ray and Mako line of watches which are absolutely gorgeous and original in design but they cost around 14k - 17k on Amazon India. Meanwhile I had my eyes on this Invicta Prodiver 8926OB even though a lot of people in watch community dislike Invicta as a company, but like this particular watch model. So when I checked, the prices were fluctuating between 7k to 9k and I was not willing to pay that money for an Invicta, but recently the prices dropped to around 5800 bucks and I jumped on it. Honestly, there are no regrets since.\n\nThe dimensions are, 40mm dia bezel excluding crown, the lug width is 20mm. It wears marvellously on smaller wrist like mine even though it wears a little bit taller on the wrist. It has a 120 click rotating bezel and the action on the bezel is very solid and easy to rotate thanks to coinage on the bezel. There are applied markers and applied winged Invicta logo which looks really good and the hands are very Rolex inspired Mercedes hands, both have loom but the loom on the markers are very dim when compared to loom on the hands. There is a loom pip on the bezel at 12 o’clock position that helps in orientation of the watch in the dark. The watch has a mixture of brushed and mirror finishes that is done impeccably well and it gives a beautiful lustre to the watch especially on that aluminium insert of the bezel and glossy black dial of the watch. There is a cyclops on the mineral glass exactly above the date window that magnifies it for improved legibility. Some people don’t like the cyclops but personally, I don’t mind it. The crown is a screw down crown with crown guards. I’m really impressed with the crown on this watch. It has a perfect size to screw, unscrew or wind the watch with ease, and it is signed with Invicta cross that aligns perfectly when completely screwed in. Another impressive thing in this watch is the display back, it shows the automatic movement in all its glory.\n\nSpeaking of the movement, it is the best part in this watch. It is a Japanese caliber NH35A movement, basically it is an unbranded version of Seiko movement caliber 4R35 which can be found in sub 30,000₹ Seiko watches. It is most popular automatic movement in micro brands too. This movement is automatic of course(for those who don’t know it doesn’t require a battery and works on your movements) but it has hacking(seconds hand stops when crown is pulled out) and manual wind functions as well. According to the official site it has an accuracy of -20 to +20 seconds per day but I’m happy to report it is given me an impressive +7 seconds per day.\n\nThe bracelet which it comes on is completely solid with brushed and mirror finishes. End links are hollow but it is expected in this price range. I must say it looks really good on the bracelet but you can most definitely order some nato straps (preferably on AliExpress 😬 sorry amazon, you lack collection in this regard) and dress it down a bit. And because of the Rolex aesthetics, this watch is a strap monster. It looks freakin amazing with any strap you put it on.\n\nI must say, I’ve washed clothes wearing it, I’ve been to weddings with it, I’ve been on a bike ride with it, I went swimming with it, you name it. I’ve even dropped it once accidentally but it did not stop ticking.\n\nI’ve tried to take and post as many pictures as I can for you to decide but I gotta say it’s one of the best wrist watches at the price range. Absolutely go for it if you like the design and if it suits your budget. At the end of the day if something brings you joy and happiness, it’s worth it.\n\nRegards,\nMS', 'Reviewer Name': 'M S', 'Review Date': 'Reviewed in India on 24 January 2019'}, {'Review Rating': '5.0', 'Review Text': 'This is a wonderful watch.

Perciò, se avete dubbi su questo orologio, vi posso assicurare che è un ottimo prodotto, costruito benissimo e con precisione. Questo a me è arrivato oggi, ma ne possiedo già un altro uguale da un anno.... con Dial e lunetta blù e dettagli Disney topolino davvero molto particolare, e che certamente non poteva mancare nella mia collezione personale.... perciò posso giudicare questo pro-Diver a pieni voti! Si presenta molto elegante, massiccio ma molto leggero al polso...e per quanto sia un bell\' orologio così costruito con precisione e dettagli ben rifiniti, lascia la sensazione di avere un costo molto più elevato rispetto ai poco più di 100,00 € che l\'ho pagato. Ragazzi, se siete in cerca di un bell\'orologio, con un ottimo meccanismo e bello massiccio come questo, siete nel posto giusto! Se invece, siete alla ricerca di un orologio uguale al Rolex submariner, dovete andare a spendere migliaia di euro in più perché questo è un orologio BELLISSIMO, ma non ha nulla a che vedere con il rolex submariner. A me piace moltissimo, e ho voluto averlo nella mia collezione personale, proprio perché è un orologio originale, che non ha nulla a che vedere con i più blasonati.... certi lo chiamano ""Homage "" io invece lo chiamo Invicta pro-Diver 89260B perché è così che si chiama!

Quanto ai tempi di spedizione, qui sono molto deluso... acquisto in amazon dal 2010, e non ho mai avuto problemi di spedizione.... questa volta ho acquistato questo orologio, che sarebbe dovuto arrivare il 24 Settembre, e invece la spedizione era in ritardo marcio... per di più ho dovuto combattere con il servizio clienti dovendo spiegare l\'italiano agli operatori stranieri.... che operano per l\'Italia, ma non capiscono la nostra lingua!!

L'orologio, a mio parere, è da configurarsi tra gli sportwatch. L'ho testato in diverse modalità, trail running, trekking, corsa su strada e bici. Il Gps, maxtrac, c'è e funziona bene: rispetto al Garmin (fascia bassa) che utilizzavo prima, si connette più velocemente e fornisce una traccia più precisa. A mio parere questo attrezzo registra il percorso di continuo fornendo una traccia grezza e immediata, quindi reale, dell'intero percorso. Lo smart che utilizzavo, probabilmente, registrava a tratti e poi elaborava una traccia in linea retta che sovrapposta alla mappa dava come risultato il mio passaggio su tetti e alberi. Correndo mi sono spostato, tra alti palazzi, da un marciapiede all'altro. La traccia ha registrato in maniera perfetta i miei spostamenti. Ho corso con pioggia e grandine e non ho riscontrato alcun problema. Il collegamento con l'app Strava è semplice ed immediato. E' possibile inviare tracce gpx all'orologio tramite l'app dedicata ZEPP. E' possibile seguire il percorso in due diverse modalità: mappa orientata a nord e direzione di corsa: il risultato è comunque buono. Con la mappa orientata a nord lo smart indica (vibrando contestualmente) dove e quando girare, ed è anche possibile scegliere la distanza di preavviso (ad es 20/50 .. metri prima di una svolta vibra e indica la direzione). In modalità direzione corsa le svolte sono intuitive. E' possibile scegliere e diversificare le colorazioni della traccia da seguire e del percorso che si sta percorrendo. Le funzioni sonno, i dati salute, i passi ecc ecc sono tutti presenti. Lo smart è in grado di riconoscere in automatico alcuni sport. Confermo il riconoscimento di trekking corsa ecc.. Ho disattivato la funzione perché lo smart registrava ogni mia passeggiata come trekking consumando batteria. Consiglio l'orologio per gli sport outdoor ma non mi esprimo per il nuoto (piscina e mare) non avendolo testato.\nIl prodotto è davvero leggero, sia durante l'attività che di notte, è come non averlo.\nLa rilevazione della frequenza cardiaca e del livello di ossigenazione del sangue coincidono con i dati che il mio medico (da me non avvisato) mi ha fornito in corso di visita di controllo.\nLo consiglio per gli sport outdoor"", 'Reviewer Name': 'Lucio', 'Review Date': 'Reviewed in Italy on 13 September 2024'}, {'Review Rating': '5.0', 'Review Text': 'Llevó con el 10 días y estoy encantado y sorprendido\nLo uso como reloj y para entrenar.

I liked what I saw in the sales post, but think this watch would make a wonderful gift for any occasion. The contour of the face is eye-catching without being too much. I tested the luminescence and found I could identify time well enough. Case height is average. I do plan on adding a glass face protector to go on top to protect the original glass. This watch is 5 ATM so can withstand water pressure up to a depth of 50 meters before it suffers water damage. Personally, I wouldn't purposefully swim with a 5 ATM with a leather band, but it's comforting to know this watch is okay swimming for short periods of time or even worn in the shower and rain.\n\nPACKAGING: Amazon shipped this in a bubble envelope which adequately protected the standard, and squarish, FOSSIL tin container with teal and orange accents; the same tin shown in the sales ad photos.

It is submitted that I, had bought Samsung galaxy 4 watch from Amozon .in Portal which was sold to me by Future Tech, Thane-421302 dated 19.01.2022. (Hopefully, an OEM authorized vendor/reseller).\n\n3. That, within 6 months of usage the watch has developed an issue with display: \' Black Screen\' / No display; for which I had reported to Samsung authorized centre at Kochi (Service Centre: 0002395789--Qdigi Services Limited).\n\n4. That, to my surprise service Centre denied a free warranty stating that the product is an overseas product, further justifying that the last three alphabets Model No:SM- R870NZSAMEA shows the country of origin of the product and that the product under mention is not an Indian product thus, Warranty is Void.\n\n5. It is pertinent to mention that, as the product was bought from Amazon.in Portal from a Samsung and Amazon authorised Indian reseller, it is unacceptable that the warranty for the product is denied, with an estimated cost for repair given as 9960/- (Nine Thousand Nine Hundred and Sixty).\n\n6. In view of the above, it is requested to please provide support in the above matter by providing clarification on the product whether it is an Indian or an overseas brand. Also, as the product was bought in good faith by Samsung\'s authorised reseller from Amazon.in portal, thus it is a kind request for needful action in context to the warranty and repair of the product. It is submitted for consideration please, that I am an Indian Armed Forces/ Defence employee, the product was bought with great enthusiasm, however, the present scenario and incidence has not only caused my faith on the portal compromised but also I feel cheated.\n\n7. Further to the above, I approached amazon.in portal help desk, for support, where in I was told by the rep that he requires a validation email from Samsung, that the product under mention is an \'overseas product\' and that the facts with respect to \'warranty void\' stated by the Samsung service Centre are Genuine.\nI am surprised with the acumen of the Amazon Help Desk Rep , even after my repeated highlighting the point that, "" when on Samsung portal/software, as my products model number is being entered, the central server is automatically showing the product as an oversea product with Warranty Void option at respective boxes"",(same has been highlighted by me on document attached). However , the rep wants me to get mail which is a pointless demand just to trouble the customer.\n\n8. It is reiterated that documents furnished by me is from Samsung authorised service Centre and screen shot is of Samsung portal which gives info from central server, nothing can be and nothing is manipulated fromany end(s).\n\n9. Still I have requested Samsung to furnish an email with required information, but response is awaited and doubtful.\n\n10. However, The very fact that the watch was bought from Amazon.in with faith of prime member on the portal, a customer on trust purchases costly items and expect that Amazon back end has done all the checks before registering the vendor/seller and checking the product being sold. Thus,as the product is hardly 06 months old and I in all true letter and spirit bought the product in India (Proof attached) from Amazon.in portal , genuine consideration , HELP and SUPPORT by Amazon team is requested and expected.', 'Reviewer Name': 'Dr Ronauk Singh', 'Review Date': 'Reviewed in India on 7 July 2022'}, {'Review Rating': '5.0', 'Review Text': ""This is watch might be old now, but when you are buying a product 2 years after its launch at a much much discounted price, then you can't really complain.\n\nMost health tracking features work flawlessly, the tracking is quite precise nearly 95% of times.

Then days later, I was watching the 1994 Jean-Claude Van Damme movie Timecop, and saw him wearing a fancy Casio DW-400 watch. It looked pretty cool, so I decided to buy a Casio digital watch for a change. One look at the Casio watches at Amazon, and I discovered this awesome G-Shock series watch. It liked the color and the design looked very modern and manly too: a nice combo of digital and analog, something I've never seen in any watch before. However, the only drawback is that setting the time in this watch is kind of a pain in the butt, because the time has to be set digitally with the buttons provided, unlike a proper analog watch where you just have a simple knob on the side to do it. Hence, I have to keep referring to the owner's manual in order to do so.\n\nOverall, with a sturdy build quality, immense reliability, superb technology, and a water resistance of 200m, this watch's advantages clearly outweighs it's minor drawbacks.

It feels quite heavy and large on my small wrist which is about 55mm across the wrist and 15cm circumference (female). The weight may be reduced by removing some links.\n\nColour:\nVery nice rose-gold, like pale 'salmon'. I was unable to match the true colour on the photo. Overall, the colour is pleasing.\n\nMy verdict:\nI was tempted to return the watch because it felt too large and bulky on my small wrist. Yet, after having worn it for a few hours during work, I decided to keep it and I am starting to like the look of the large watch. I also like that the face can be illuminated. For a more elegant look, for ladies with small wrists, I may recommend a smaller watch. I am quite tempted to purchase a smaller, stainless steel, ladies' watch for a more casual look. I have to say, my CASIO watches have never failed me.\n\nDimensions, which I may have measured differently to the manufacturer’s:\n\nStainless watch overall, across wrist, incl. extension for wristband attachments: 40mm\nWidth along length of wrist: 37mm\nDisplay face: 20mm x 13mm\nSize of hour figures: 7mm\nMinute figures: 5mm\nDate figures: 3mm\nBand length with fixed catch: 70mm\nBand length with movable catch: 105mm\nBand width: 17mm\nLinks: 6mm\nWeight with all band links: about 65g\n\n65g does not appear ‘heavy’, but if one is not used to wearing a stainless-steel watch it ‘feels’ heavy and bulky to start with. The length of the links is ample for a larger wrist. Links may be removed by a service centre which would make the watch less 'heavy'.\n\nI also purchased the following watch for use on my camping trips: https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B00HFPIIOI?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details This is a replacement for the same watch I’ve had for too many years to remember and which has never failed me (size comparison on photo below). The main reason I purchased a replacement was because the band on my ‘old’ watch broke (most likely material fatigue after years of swimming in chlorinated water, wearing the watch daily and not wiping it every now and then) It was quicker to purchase a new (and very cheap) watch than trying to hunt around for a replacement band."", 'Reviewer Name': 'zinnnia', 'Review Date': 'Reviewed in Australia on 23 June 2024'}, {'Review Rating': '5.0', 'Review Text': 'Lindo, leve...simplesmente apaixonada.', 'Reviewer Name': 'eliene andrade', 'Review Date': 'Reviewed in Brazil on 7 December 2022'}]",588,In stock,"{'item_weight': '59 g', 'case_material': 'Stainless Steel', 'crystal_material': 'Glass', 'band_material': 'Stainless Steel', 'water_resistant_depth': '50 Meters'}",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61PRynUbNBL._SX679_.jpg

Posso dizer que é um relógio mecânico de boa qualidade onde a resistência do vidro, bem como dos metais da caixa e pulseira é muito boa. Reparei que sua máquina possui joias e rodas de metal, contribuindo na qualidade e durabilidade do mecanismo. Percebi que a precisão é mediana e nada surpreendente: adiantou ou atrasou aproximadamente 1 min por semana. O que, considerando sua faixa de preço e acabamento, esta dentro do esperado. Ao meu ver, possui um design que não tem nada de inovador nem luxuoso, mas também não deixa a desejar e nem de longe pode ser considerado feio.\n\nEm suma, entendo que a beleza deste relógio não esteja apenas em sua aparência, mas também no fato de que este possui bons atributos com valor super acessível para aqueles que pretendem adentrar no universo dos relógios mecânicos de pulso. Lembrando que, assim como qualquer outro relógio mecânico, se tomados os devidos cuidados quanto a exposição ao magnetismo, água aquecida, impactos ou quedas, certamente ele também te acompanhará por vários anos.', 'Reviewer Name': 'Antonio Pasolini', 'Review Date': 'Reviewed in Brazil on 26 January 2023'}, {'Review Rating': '5.0', 'Review Text': 'Buen relación precio mercancía.Mantine exacto la reloj', 'Reviewer Name': 'alex', 'Review Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on 29 January 2022'}, {'Review Rating': '4.0', 'Review Text': 'Great Looking Watch but the self winding not much to talk about need to wind it up everyday but I do like this Watch', 'Reviewer Name': 'BILL HUNT', 'Review Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on 28 May 2022'}]",431,In stock,"{'item_weight': '50 g', 'case_material': 'Stainless Steel', 'crystal_material': None, 'band_material': 'Stainless Steel', 'water_resistant_depth': '30 Meters'}",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71vo1GMvDBL._SX679_.jpg
Watch for Men Fashion Business Men Watches Ultra-Thin Waterproof Chronograph Quartz Watches with Stainless Steel Band,NIBOSI,2421,NIBOSI-2309,3.8,"[{'Review Rating': '5.0', 'Review Text': ""This watch is a very nice and light watch, it is one of the beat watches under 3000 INR and is a 5/5 for me. There is a feature they have not shown in the image which is luminous function at night it's really helpful when you are travelling and if you just want to enjoy your time while not looking at your phone every now and then for time. One important thing to note id that if you get the chronograph settings at 3' O clock or 7'O clock or the chronograph os basically not at 12'O clock position then just set the dial button to '2' or simply pull it out to the position where you can change the time and then press the upper button/ Button 'A' for changing the 1/10 Sec hand or long press the Button 'B' to change your Second hand( If you change the second hand your min hand will also change for the chronograph and to avoid that long press the button until the minute hand comes till 58 or 59 minutes and then simply just continously press the button 'B' instead of long pressing it so that you can Artange the minute hand and second hand at 12'O clock) then simply just set the dial to current time and your watch will function normally. When you now press the start/stop button and reset the chronograph it will definitely come back to 00( For sec and 1/10 Second hand) and 60(For min hand). Also I'd like to mention that it's strap feels premium so no worrying about the strap( It's easy to remove also)"", 'Reviewer Name': 'Pankaj', 'Review Date': 'Reviewed in India on 21 November 2023'}, {'Review Rating': '1.0', 'Review Text': ""After use 3 month...watch not working well date & time not match...watch back side colour fant ... colour quality very bad...metal also very bad.... don't waste money"", 'Reviewer Name': 'shrikant salekar', 'Review Date': 'Reviewed in India on 7 October 2024'}, {'Review Rating': '5.0', 'Review Text': 'Nice look', 'Reviewer Name': 'SANJEEV SAMANT', 'Review Date': 'Reviewed in India on 16 October 2024'}, {'Review Rating': '4.0', 'Review Text': 'Very good', 'Reviewer Name': 'Arun kumar shasany', 'Review Date': 'Reviewed in India on 8 September 2024'}, {'Review Rating': '5.0', 'Review Text': 'Its chronograph systen is cool', 'Reviewer Name': 'DINESH KUMAR', 'Review Date': 'Reviewed in India on 5 October 2024'}, {'Review Rating': '3.0', 'Review Text': 'Received same watch as per the Amazon product photo.
